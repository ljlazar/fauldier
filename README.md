FAULDIER (**F**ramework for l**A**rge lang**U**age mode**L** assiste**D** l**I**fe cycl**E** invento**R**y) aims to automate the transformation of heterogeneous input data into standardized formats for **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**, utilizing **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Process and Elementary Flow Mapping**  
  - Enables automated mapping of raw input data from a spreadsheet to the Brightway LCA software, with support for customizable, rule-based transformations to ensure compliance with database requirements.

- **LLM-Assisted Data Harmonization**  
  - Automates mapping of non-standardized input data to Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database requirements using Large Language Models (LLMs).
  - Corrects **typographical errors**, resolves **linguistic variations**, and supports **multilingual inputs**.
  - Converts units. 
  - Harmonizes location granularity mismatches.
  - Selects proxies for missing processes.
  - 
- **Dynamic Adaptation to Database Updates** (not tested)  
  - LLM assistance enables the system to adapt to changes in database terminology, structural modifications, and integration with other databases.

- **Open & Transparent Implementation**  
  Built with **open databases** and **open-weight LLMs**.

- **Future-Oriented Design**  
  Aims to support **prospective modeling**, and **software coupling**, enabling handling of uncertain and non-standardized data inputs. 

## Current Limitations
- Database constraints (license restrictions) and token limitations.
- Performance variability across different LLMs and in between LLM runs.
- Performance of open-weight LLMs.
- Need for confidence metrics for mapped data.

## Future Directions
- Expand testing across multiple LCI databases and use cases.
- Develop pre-processing procedures.
- Develop confidence scoring for mappings.
- Explore integration with additional LLM architectures.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Access to an LLM API

### Requirements
- Python
- LCI database such as forwast

### ðŸ“¦ Installation
